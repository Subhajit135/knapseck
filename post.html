           <h1>ABOUT KWOC</h1>
            <p>Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for the students, who are new to open source software development. The programme not only helps students to get involved in open source, but also preps them for many open source summer programmes, Google Summer of Code being one of them.</p>

            <h1>PROJECT REPORT</h1>
            <p><strong>Choosing the Project:</strong> To be honest this was the most toughest part as there was so many interesting projects that i want to work on. But after short listing i finally worked on two projects. Being a python developer it's is my privilege to contribute in the open-source communinity. So i participated in python currated list and my mentor for this project was <strong>Prateek Chanda</strong> and the project was <strong>CODE SLEEP PYTHON</strong> and also being a typical maths lover it was irrestible to ignore the projects related to algorithms so i also contributed to <strong>SMVDU-ALGOS</strong> which was mentored by <strong>Sushil khanchi | Shubham Goyal</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Progress Report:</strong> First i have started contributing to the project <strong>"CODE SLEEP PYTHON"</strong>, it was a curated list of various python projects, i contributed some projects like <strong>Koch Snowflake</strong> - The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve. After that i contributed <strong>superellipse</strong> - A superellipse, also known as a Lamé curve after Gabriel Lamé, is a closed curve resembling the ellipse, retaining the geometric features of semi-major axis and semi-minor axis, and symmetry about them, but a different overall shape. </p>
            
            <p>After that I got interested in the project named <strong>SMVDU-ALGOS</strong> which is basically another repo covering a curated list of algorithms where i first contributed <strong>COCKTAIL SHAKER SORT</strong> basically an sorting algorithm which i implemented in python. After that i have contributed <strong>A* algorithm</strong> - one of the smartest path finding algorithm based on heurestics out in the wild, which i also implemented in python.</p>
            
            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>It was great initiative to get started to open source contribution for me, along with also getting an rough idea about GSoC. Basically i was able to contribute 4  articles in two repositories.</p>
